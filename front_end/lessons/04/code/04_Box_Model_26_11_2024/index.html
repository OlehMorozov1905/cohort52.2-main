          <h2>Brazil</h2>
          <p>
            Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about
            85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In
            Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing
            cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is produced almost
            exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much
            smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is
            robusta.

          <h2>Colombia</h2>
          <p>
            Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee
            beans. Colombia's average annual coffee production of 11.5 million
            bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and
            Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica bean. The beans are
            exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most
            coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.

          <h2>India</h2>
          <p>
            Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall
            conditions, is also termed as Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor
            is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of
            Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two
            well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta.
            Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast
            Asia is S.795.
